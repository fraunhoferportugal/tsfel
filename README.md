# Time Series Feature Extraction Library
## Intuitive time series feature extraction
This repository hosts the **TSFEL - Time Series Feature Extraction Library** python package. TSFEL assists researchers on
exploratory feature extraction tasks on time series without requiring significant programming effort.


## Installation

```python
pip install tsfel
```

## Includes a comprehensive number of features
TSFEL is optimized for time series and **automatically extracts over 60 different features on the statistical, temporal and spectral domains.**

## Functionalities
* **Intuitive, fast deployment and reproducible**: interactive UI for feature selection and customization
* **Computational complexity evaluation**: estimate the computational effort before extracting features
* **Comprehensive documentation**: each feature extraction method has a detailed explanation
* **Unit tested**: we provide unit tests for each feature
* **Easily extended**: adding new features is easy and we encourage you to contribute with your custom features

## Get started
The code below extracts all the available features on an example dataset file.

```python
import tsfel
import pandas as pd

# load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Dataset.txt')

# Retrieves a pre-defined feature configuration file to extract all available features
cfg = tsfel.feature_extraction.features_settings.get_features_by_domain()

# Extract features
X = tsfel.feature_extraction.calc_features.time_series_features_extractor(cfg, df)
```
